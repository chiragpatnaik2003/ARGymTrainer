# ARGymTrainer
AR Gym Trainer is a markerless augmented reality (AR) application developed using Unity and ARCore. It allows users to visualize and interact with virtual gym trainers performing exercises like Bench Press, Skull Crusher, and Bicep Curl in their real-world environment. The app uses ARCore to detect horizontal planes, enabling users to tap on surfaces to spawn selected 3D models. Users can choose an exercise via buttons, and the selected trainer is automatically rotated and scaled for optimal placement. Additional features include scaling and rotating the models using UI controls. This project showcases the potential of AR in fitness, providing an immersive way to learn workout techniques. The GitHub repository includes assets, scripts, and scene files for easy setup and customization.
